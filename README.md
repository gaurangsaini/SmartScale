## A Wii balance board weight reporter to HLPC webapp hosted on GCE

This script is a fork of [this awesome script right here](https://github.com/skorokithakis/gr8w8upd8m8), which in turn is based on [wiiboard-simple](https://code.google.com/p/wiiboard-simple/), with some dependencies (like
pygame) removed. I'm pretty sure it only works on Linux.
